# Darwin World Simulation üåøüêæ  

A Java-based desktop application that simulates an ecosystem inspired by Charles Darwin‚Äôs theory of natural selection. Users can customize various parameters, observe real-time interactions within the environment, and analyze statistical data.  

This project was developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course at AGH University of Krakow by:  
- **Oskar Blajsz** [[Blajszu]](https://github.com/Blajszu)
- **Jagoda Kurosad** [[jagodakurosad]](https://github.com/jagodakurosad)

Detailed project guidelines (in Polish) are available [here](./project_description/). The implemented version follows the **F1 variant**.

## üåç Overview  

The simulation represents a world populated by herbivores that roam in search of food to maintain their energy levels and find partners to reproduce. Over time, natural selection and genetic inheritance shape the species, influencing their behaviors and survival strategies. 

The world consists of a **grid-based map** with two primary terrain types:  
- **Steppes** ‚Äì where plants grow sparsely.  
- **Jungle areas** ‚Äì where vegetation regenerates quickly, creating a food-rich environment.  

Each animal possesses an **energy reserve**, which depletes over time. Survival depends on:  
‚úîÔ∏è **Finding and consuming plants** to regain energy.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Navigating the map** based on genetic instructions.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Reproducing** if energy levels are high enough.  

### üîÑ Daily Cycle in the Simulation:  
‚úîÔ∏è **Removal of deceased animals** from the ecosystem.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Animals decide their movements** based on genetic instructions.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Plants are consumed** by animals.  
‚úîÔ∏è **Breeding occurs** between animals on the same tile with sufficient energy.  
‚úîÔ∏è **New plants grow** in available locations.  

This process continuously reshapes the population, providing insights into evolutionary mechanisms.

### üìú Presets  
The app includes **predefined simulation setups** for quick experimentation. Users can also **save and load** custom configurations as CSV files.  

> [!NOTE]
> Saved presets are stored in the **presetParameters** folder next to the application executable.  
> The folder will be automatically created when you first save or load presets.

### üìä Data Logging & Analysis  
Users can enable **automatic logging** of simulation data to CSV files. Logged information includes:  
‚úîÔ∏è Total number of animals.  
‚úîÔ∏è Number of plants.  
‚úîÔ∏è Free spaces on the map.  
‚úîÔ∏è Most common genetic sequences.  
‚úîÔ∏è Average energy levels.  
‚úîÔ∏è Average lifespan.  
‚úîÔ∏è Average number of offspring per animal.  

> [!NOTE]
> Logs are saved in the **simulationStatistics** folder next to the application executable.  
> The folder will be automatically created when you first run the program.
